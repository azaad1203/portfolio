			<div class="con_g1"><h1 > What can you do during Summer Holidays </h1>
				<p>Summer is effectively three months long, indeed when summer comes upon us, most people would create fun summer memories with friends, going on vacation with the family, or even putting more hours into that work schedule in order to get ahead but it's also a perfect time to find a summer job, fill the pocket with some cash and obtain another experience to add in the CV. Things that you can do during your summer holidays:
				<br>
				Be spontaneous
Summer is the season to relax and let-loose. Getting spontaneous can mean anything from jumping in the car with a few close friends for a weekend far from home, to going for a swim while jump in the water with your clothes on. Unplanned adventures are often the most fun of all because they contain that extra element of surprise that makes you feel more alive. A summer without spontaneity is no good summer at all. 
				<br>
				Multi task.
In order to fit as much as possible into your super charged summer, occasionally you're going to have to do one or two things at the same time. Don't worry, it's not at all as hard as it may sound, most good things to multi task are as simple as catching up on your reading while sitting on the beach. If your laptop is necessary, find a nice place along the beach with a deck where you can grab a drink or a bite to eat and enjoy the weather while you work. 
				<br>
				Ride a bike. 
Biking gets you out of that stuffy car and frustrating traffic and acts as a mode of transportation that really lets you feel that gorgeous summer day on your skin. Additionally on a bike there's a whole set of different routes available to take to where you need to go, so that you'll never have to take the same way to work again. All in one shot you can be outside, have the sun on your back, and be in transit. Of course, peddling everywhere you go can also double as a great work-out that you hardly know you're getting in. Get in shape this summer by riding everywhere; you'll never have to worry about squeezing in that daily workout again.
				<br>
				Take a class. 
Summer is the time to get creative and explore yourself in a new form. Chances are your everyday work life keeps you away from doing or learning something you've always wanted to do. Take advantage of the extra time you have this summer by experiencing something new and of interest to you. Take that self-defense class you've been trying to fit in to your schedule, learn French, take a ballet class, embrace the summertime with horse-back riding lessons through the riding trails, or brush up on your traditional education with a college course or two. Enroll in a program that is constructive and builds on what you learn and experience every time you go. Summer school has never been more fun. 
				<br>
				Throw and go to parties
Show your friends a fun time and a break from the pressing world of responsibility by hosting a summer themed party. Get everyone you know in the backyard or on the beach to enjoy a night of summer fun. Get creative with the dress code, new drink recipes, party decorations, and the entertainments like: bring out sports, string up the pi√±ata and fire up the grill. Most importantly, don't let the fun stop there. 
				<br>
				Re-shape yourself. 
Make your summer all about change treat yourself to a day at the spa, nurture your body by eating healthy, wholesome foods all summer long, dye your hair, use a new color to paint your nails, buy some new clothes that you really like but wouldn't normally pick out for yourself, pick-up an interesting book that inspires you to think differently about something. Whatever change(s) you decide to make, make sure they're positive ones that you want to make and that celebrate and further express the person you are. Changes can be fun and liberating, let the change in season inspire a little change in you.
				<br>
				Remember that time is precious. 
Since summer is only three months long, make sure that you do something with every day you have. Don't stay in because the 95 degree high makes it miserable outside, go to the beach and cool yourself off in the water, not in the house with the AC on full-blast. The important thing is to get out there and go learn, explore, re-invent, and have fun. And if at the end of the day things haven't all gone exactly according to plan, don't worry because each day is a new opportunity to get the most out of your summer.

			<div class="con_g2"><h1>About Summer Job</h1>
				<p>
				During the summer months many companies hire additional staff, so it is an ideal time for students seeking part-time employment. A summer job is really a productive way to spend your summer for some reasons. Firstly, you are earning money, which you can put towards something constructive for instance living costs at University in the following year. A summer job also breaks the monotony of sitting around at home. Some other reason to get a job is the fact that you will meet and interact with new people, and might make some new friends. You can find a range of summer jobs that offer you the chance to earn money and skills and still you will find some time to enjoy the sun. All you need to know is where and how to look.
				<br>
				Don't wait until the school year is over to begin your summer job search. Have something lined up for the summer by starting your job search now. Some seasonal employers like camps and amusement parks are already holding job fairs and other employers are starting to post summer openings too. 
				<br>
				The second key is to be prepared. While it is always essential to have a resume and cover letter when applying for a job, it is even more important for teens to bring the right credentials now since they have to prove that employers should hire them over more experienced workers. Bring a resume and a cover letter whenever you apply for a job. It shows that you are serious about the position, and that you are mature and responsible enough to handle the job.
