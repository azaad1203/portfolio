			<div class="con_g1"><h1>How to find an Internship</h1>
			<p>
			First, consider your academic and personal goals. Also consider your strengths and values. Do you want to work for a non-profit? Then focus your search there. Do you want to do advertising, anywhere? Then search by category, concentrating on ones related to that field (e.g., Advertising, Marketing, Public Relations). Write a goal statement for yourself: "I would like an internship that will give me an opportunity to...." This statement will guide your search. If you're struggling to clarify your career goals, consider taking one of the career explorations and planning courses we offer (you can contact our team for more information), Explore as many internship options as possible. If you have trouble finding the right internship, try creating your own. Decide what you want to do and find an organization that will support you. Keep in mind that smaller, lesser-known organizations often provide internships that are just as good as internships at big companies, and tend to be more flexible. Do an informational interview with someone in an organization or field that interests you. If it seems like a good fit, ask them about internship possibilities in their organization. The Jobs4Money Career Services office provides books, hand-outs and personal tips about conducting informational interviews. Once you find an internship, negotiate a 'Learning Contract' with your site supervisor. This agreement clarifies your expectations and those of your supervisor and maps out a plan for you as you work through your internship. Some experiences are centred around a specific project--a campaign, for example--so your agreement should be written with this project in mind.

			<div class="con_g2"><h1>Why do an Internship</h1>
			<p>
			1.	An internship is your best chance to test out potential career choices. You'll get real-life experience doing the work of an employee in an organization. 
			<br>
			2.	An internship is also a good way to learn about different management styles and work environments. Internships help you learn what type of work suits you. 
			<br>
			3.	An internship helps you develop professional skills and build a network of contacts. This will help you later when you begin your job search.
			<br>
			4.	An internship is the best way to connect the learning you are doing in the classroom to the world of work. Basically, you'll learn by doing.
			<br>
			5.	An internship will help you get a job after you graduate. Employers seek job candidates with some type of experience. Internships build your resume and increase your chances of getting hired later.

			<div class="con_g3"><h1>Significant tips</h1>
			<p>
			When you bring up details of a vacancy, you may be asked a series of 'key questions'. It's important to answer these accurately: they're questions from the employer, aimed at helping them check that you're the sort of graduate they're looking for. Once you've got the details, double-check how the employer wants you to apply and make sure your CV, covering letter or application is up to scratch. If you're asked to attend an interview or assessment day, it's well worth doing some preparation. 
			</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="con_g4"><h1>Apply</h1>
			<p>
				Before you start looking for an internship, ask yourself:
				<br>
				1.	What career are you looking for?
				<br>
				2.	Where do you want to work - and can you be flexible in terms of location?
				<br>
				3.	When can you start?
				<br>
				4.	How long are you available for? 
				<br>
				5.	Are you looking for a paid place, one that's unpaid - or one that will cover your expenses?
				<br>
				It's important to have a clear idea of what kind of internship you want, but being flexible will improve your chances. If you can't find an internship in your ideal line of work, try looking at related fields. Make sure you also know what to expect from your employer. For example, if you’re effectively performing as a ‘worker’, in most cases you should be paid the national minimum wage. See ‘Graduate internships and placements’ to find out about pay, conditions and more. Once you've decided what sort of place you're after, you're ready to find an internship. Don't worry if you can't find the right internship straight away – employers add vacancies regularly. To see details of how to apply for each internship vacancy, you’ll need to register with the Jobs4Money . Once you’ve registered, you can also ask to get emails with the latest vacancies.

			<p>
			Jennifer Batliwalla studied a BSc in management and accounting at Royal Holloway, University of London. She undertook a 12-month paid internship with accountancy firm, Ernst and Young. A year in industry wasn't a compulsory part of my course, but it was something I felt strongly about and really wanted to do. I was keen to 'road test' accountancy, before I entered into a full time career to see if I enjoyed it. I attended several careers fairs and talked to representatives from the 'big four' firms and felt that Ernst and Young came across as a real 'people place'. After a rigorous application process, I was offered a one-year industrial placement with the audit practice in London. During my placement I was completely integrated into the team, and was given the opportunity to attend client meetings; take on similar projects to that of a first-year graduate; and was put through two of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland's (ICAS) accountancy qualifications. As part of my role with the audit team, I was also lucky enough to spend two months of my internship working for the firm in Boston, Massachusetts and was selected to attend an international internship conference in Florida, which were both fantastic opportunities. The industrial placement provided me with a real insight into the accountancy profession and confirmed that this was the career path I wanted to follow. I now work with Ernst and Young in the audit team, specializing in the industrial and consumer products industry. I would recommend an industrial placement to anyone.
