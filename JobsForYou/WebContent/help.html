			National Insurance
If you want to work in the UK you will need a National Insurance Number. National Insurance is a compulsory Government Tax that is automatically deducted from your pay if you earn more than Â£110 each week. Your National Insurance number is a unique personal reference number used by the Government's Revenue and Customs Department to work out how much National Insurance you must pay when you work. 
You will usually have to pay about 11% of your pay. 
If you don't already have a National Insurance number, your employer may issue you with a temporary one so you can start work, but you will need to get a permanent one. Some employers will ask you to get a National Insurance number before you can start working for them.

Documents needed to obtain National Insurance
Your passport
Proof of your UK address (such as a utility bill or bank statement)
Proof that you're a student at the University of Reading
Proof that you're looking for work or have started working, such as an application form that you're going to complete to apply for a job, a letter from a recruitment agency showing that you've registered with them to find work, a letter from an employer showing that you've been offered a job or that you've not been successful when you applied for a job, or your pay slip or contract of employment.

			Jobs Searching Tips

Friends and Family
A good starting point for employment is asking friends and family if they know of anything going, particularly if you are after experience in a specific field. Some jobs are based on networking, in which X person knows a friend of a friend who has a vacancy and you might be just lucky enough to get it. You can be lucky in these respects and some of you may most likely get your first job this way.

Search for Yourself
Basic Lost Wonder Searching
If friends and family don't have any suggestions, you need to widen the search. Keep an eye out for "Recruiting" ads in shops and such. If there is one, go in and ask about the job, and if needs be, bring in a CV. Just keep an eye out for job vacancies advertised in shop windows. Sometimes its worth calling into shops, or cafes/restaurants and asking if they need staff. It might be something they are thinking about but not got round to, and you will have much less competition.
The Job Center
If the job hunt is not going so well, a good place to start is the Job Centre. This tends to be more helpful if you are looking for a job as a school leaver, rather than with a degree, as there will be more relevant jobs.
From Internet
There are a huge variety of jobs websites around, so if you patience enough while search it on internet you will find one that suitable and match your degree.

			Top 10 CV Tips

Job title and description
It is always good practice to provide an explanation of your responsibilities/duties as well as your job title when listing your work experience. We see CVs where the job title is very vague or does not accurately convey the proper role undertaken - it is therefore important you provide recruiters with a concise description of what you actually did.
Listing achievements
In an increasingly competitive graduate job market employers are looking for the most talented individuals to join their organisation. No recruiter wants to hire an "average" candidate and a recruitment consultant will not want to represent an "average" candidate. In an increasingly competitive job market you will need to make yourself stand out. We've all had achievements in our life so make sure you identify them in order to market yourself effectively.
Precise not ambiguous
Recruiters need to know the nature, size and location of your past employers, and what their business is. Also it will help the person who is reading your CV if you quantify your achievements. For example, if you completed a placement at a large financial services group working in customer services, instead of writing "Dealt with customers daily", a better alternative would be "Solved over 90 customer enquiries per day".
Definitions
You must always think about the language you've used on your CV so that the reader understands what you saying. Typically candidates use words or phrases that are specific to their degree or previous work experience without defining them on the CV. If a recruiter sees something like this, he or she may become confused and will stop reading your CV and move on to the next one.
Emphasise importance
Normally the most important experience on your CV is your most recent experience - but this does depend on the type of position you are applying for. Also bear in mind the requirements of the position you are applying for. You can use the requirements to help you decide which elements of your previous experience/jobs are most relevant. For example, if you wish to be considered for a marketing job, don't write one paragraph describing your current marketing assistant role, followed by two paragraphs about your part-time supermarket role three years ago.
Objective
As we've mentioned before, your CV only has around fifteen seconds to make an impression. Employers don't like to have to pick through CVs for information to make a decision on your suitability for the role. Make it easy for the recruiter to easily qualify your suitability for the position by having an objective at the top of your CV. This summarises the knowledge you've gained from your degree and previous relevant work experience.
Length and relevance
No recruiter wants to read about your entire life story through your CV, so keep your CV to two pages at the most. Remember that the point of a CV is to get you an interview, not a job, so it needs to be easy to read, precise and also demonstrate that you are an achiever with the skills, knowledge and abilities to perform successfully in the job you are applying for.
Proof read it and get feedback
Create a CV that is free from errors. Ask as many people as possible if they will read your CV and give you their honest opinion. A second set of eyes looking over your CV will highlight any errors or inconsistencies. If someone doesn't like your CV, ask them to be more specific and find out exactly what they don't like. The more people you can ask the better. If everyone you ask says the same thing about your CV, or they have similar comments, you know that's how your CV is coming across.
Skills and achievement summary
The skills and achievement summary should ideally be near to the top of your CV below the objective. This section lets the reader see instantly that you are successful and what your key skills are. The rest of your CV will be viewed through this window of success and relevant skills.
Layout and font
Avoid any font that is difficult to read. The use of colours other than black on your CV should be avoided. To be on the safe side choose a standard conventional font. Use white space effectively so that your CV doesn't look crowded and is easy to read. Remember, if your CV is difficult to read the recruiter is likely to go on to the next CV in the pile.
CV, DO's and DONT's

DO's

Insert a 'Career Objective',at the beginning of your CV. This is a short statement outlining what you want to do. This can be tailored to a specific opportunity, helps give your CV focus and is replacing the cover letter in modern job applications.

Include the final year modules from your degree. Your degree is almost certainly the most relevant thing you have done. Your final year modules indicate your areas of expertise and are likely to add credence to your application. Equally, include a skills section that is relevant to your degree.

Use spell check. It's important for you to check the grammar because some company will not even consider a CV with a spelling mistake as this shows poor attention to detail. So it's better to get someone else to read through your CV to look for errors and suggest corrections.

Think about presentation, layout and format. Remember that your CV is your first impression. A poorly presented CV is like turning up to an interview in jeans and a tshirt! Don't overcrowd your CV. White space makes your document easier for the reader. Your CV should project a professional image. Does your CV do that? Think about the font that you use. Colours should be kept to a minimum and photographs are unnecessary. Use bold typeface to emphasise key areas.

List your most recent job / qualifications first. A prospective employer is far more interested in your degree and industrial placement than your GCSEs and your paper round!

Include all relevant information. If you don't list your A level grades it is likely that an employer will assume they are bad. So you need to also include it in your CV no matter how bad or how good it was. But leave out less important personal information such as place of birth or marital status.

If you have limited work experience highlight awards or prizes from University, sports/ society captainships, or positions of responsibility that you have had.


DONT's

Don't write seven or one page CV. Anything over two pages is excessive; one page looks like you have little to say.

Don't write long paragraphs. Keep it short and simple and ise bullet points.

Don't use the same cover letter for every application. A cover letter should be a brief note saying, why you are suitable for the specific role that you are applying for.

Don't wrote two paragraphs on your Saturday job in retail(unless you are going for retail management scheme) or your love of horse riding. You only have two pages to sell yourself. Keep things like this short and focus on other positives.

Don't write about features, write about benefits. Instead of simply saying that you have done something, state the reason why it might benefit an employer.

			How to Contact the Employer

Going into a branch Many companies, especially those in retail, do not really advertise their job vacancies in things like papers and online media. This is because hundreds come into their branch every year and ask for information about their job. If you are considering a job in somewhere like this, you should go into a store and ask about how to apply at the main reception, tills or customer services desk. Some will hand you an application form or ask you to submit a CV and Covering Letter

Telephone Some companies ask that you ring them. This maybe to get an application form posted to you or so they can explain more details about the job and its demands before you submit a CV. It can also allow them to conduct a quick telephone interview.

Email Other companies ask that you email them for any contact. This is probably to allow them to send you an application form and also to give you some documents about the job. Remember to be polite when writing a email and use the standard letter format. Your request/application will be binned if you send in a poor quality email.

Online application forms A now common way of filtering applicants is to make them fill in an online application form. It standardises the CV and also allows surveys to be put forward and the weakest applicants to be filtered out quickly.
