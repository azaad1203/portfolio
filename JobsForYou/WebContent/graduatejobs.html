			<div class="con_g1"><h1 > What is a 'graduate job'? </h1>
				<p>Traditionally a 'graduate job' has meant a job or career path for which a degree is the required entry level qualification. But today it might be more appropriate to define a graduate job as 'a job that a graduate does'.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="con_g2"><h1>Starting in 'non-graduate' jobs</h1>
				<p>
				While some students choose to pursue graduate jobs from the outset, many find that a graduate career path evolves over time. 
					<br>Graduates start work in 'non-graduate jobs' for a variety of reasons:<br>
					•	Graduates who take time out to travel, or who want to obtain further qualifications, may fund their projects through easily obtainable employment in the short term, and allow themselves time to research their longer term career options. 
				<br>	•	Some graduate employment sectors, such as the media and publishing, do not offer structured graduate entry points. Graduates enter by starting in a non-graduate job and progressing from within to a graduate role. 
				<br>	•	Financial or other pressures can lead graduates to take a non-graduate job in the first instance on leaving university. 
				<br>	•	Some graduates never seek a typical graduate career path and prefer alternative forms of employment. 
				<br>	It is increasingly common for those in non-graduate jobs to develop their roles by demonstrating higher level skills and capabilities. They expand their existing position to a graduate level job, or use it as a stepping stone to an alternative graduate role.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="con_g3"><h1>Financial benefits of Degree Study</h1>
				<p>
				Despite the increase in the number of graduates. There are still long term financial benefits of degree study.
				However, there is a wide variation in additional lifetime earnings depending on the degree subject studied. A lifetime earnings premium for those with dentistry and medicine qualifications is &#163;340,000 compared with &#163;51,549 for humanities and &#163;34,949 for the arts.
				A degree also impacts on employability. Graduates are more likely to be employed than people leaving school or college with A levels or equivalent qualifications. They are also more likely to return to employment following any periods without work.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="con_g4"><h1>The flexible graduate job market</h1>
			<p>
			The UK job market has a high level of flexibility, with up to 75 per cent of graduate vacancies open to applicants from any degree subject. The good news is that graduates don't have to decide on your career direction before you go to university. The bad news is that graduates may find it hard to narrow down your career choices while you are there.
			Typical employment sectors which might recruit from any degree subject include:
			•	administration 
			•	advertising, marketing and PR 
			•	finance and management consultancy 
			•	publishing and media 
			•	sales, retail and buying 
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="con_g5"><h1>Why do companies want graduates from a range of subjects?</h1>
			<p>
			Employers may draw recruits from across a range of degree subjects because they:
			•	need people for general management roles that do not require subject specific knowledge 
			•	seek generic graduate capabilities such as creativity, analysis, determination, teamwork and communication, rather than specific technical knowledge 
			•	have access to a wider pool of talent from which to choose their recruits 
			•	prefer to train graduates in the roles that they need at that point in time
			Job adverts and vacancy details will therefore be specific about the skills and experience that they are looking for, rather than the degree subject. Convincing an employer of the skills that you have gained from your degree will be vital in ensuring success, as will marketing the skills that you have developed through work experience and other activities during your time at university. It is important, therefore to keep a record of the Graduate skills and World of Work skills you have developed. Use your e portfolio to keep evidence and reflect on your achievements.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="con_g6"><h1>Does this mean my degree subject was not important?</h1>
			<p>
			In many of these roles, you are likely to move away from the subject of your degree. This may be a deliberate choice on your part, or you may wish to look for an opportunity where your degree subject can add value to your ability to do the role even though it was not particularly required. How important is it to you to use your degree (and particularly any postgraduate study) directly in your work? You may find it useful to discuss this with your tutor or a careers adviser when making decisions about potential jobs and areas of employment. In any case, your degree subject will have served a vital purpose as an interesting and satisfying vehicle for acquiring a range of generic graduate skills.
