			<div class="con_g1"><h1>Why do Part Time Job?</h1>
			<p>
			Why indeed? Well, as students, it's likely that you will have to find a way to supplement the costs of your studies. Temporary or part-time work is a good way to earn cash while giving you time to study. It doesn't matter if you're at school, college or university; plenty of your peers have and continue to manage part-time jobs, so there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to manage it too. The following tips might help you find a part-time job.
			</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="con_g2"><h1>How to find a Part Time Job?</h1>
			<p>
			Apply in Person
			<br>
			Interested in retail employment? One of the best ways to find a part-time retail job, if you don't have connections that can help, is by applying in person. Walk through your local town or the mall and you'll see Help Wanted signs in many storefront windows. If you don't see a sign, ask about openings. The same scenario applies to resort or seasonal employment. Applying in person is often the best mechanism for finding a job. Students should visit their High School Guidance office or college Career Services and Student Employment offices to get listings of local part-time opportunities.
			<br>
			Search Online

			<div class="con_g3"><h1>How to apply for Part Time Job?</h1>
			<p>
			You may not need a resume and cover letter, but, you should follow these basic rules:
			<br>
			Dress should be, at the least, neat and tidy. business casual is usually appropriate. For example, khakis and a neat polo shirt would work well. No jeans or shorts, no tank tops, crop tops or anything especially low cut (shirt or pants) or too short (skirt). "Muffin top" jeans or khakis, with your belly showing, should also be on your list of what not to wear when applying for a job. Make sure your hair and fingernails are well groomed. Extreme hair styles or colors aren't going to help you get a job. Wear moderate shoes. Don't wear spike heels, platforms, flip flops or old dirty sneakers. If you have multiple piercings you might want to consider removing some of them while you are job searching.
			<br>
			Bring the information you'll need to fill out an application:
			<br>
			Schools and dates attended<br>
			Names and addresses of previous employers, if you have a worked before<br>
			Dates of employment<br>
			References (can be neighbors or teachers)<br>
			Resume (if you have one)<br>
			Know what days/hours you are available to work. 
			<br>
			Be prepared for a brief on-the-spot interview.

			<div class="con_g4"><h1>Additional Tips:</h1>
			<p>
			Are you looking for part-time work? Here are some time-saving tips that will help you find a part-time job fast: 
			<br>
			Be Prepared: <br>
			Have a telephone answering machine or voice mail system so potential employers can get in touch with you. Also be prepared to interview on-the-spot and even to get a job offer immediately.
			<br>
			Job Search Engines:<br>
			Search the part-time job sites. These sites focus on part-time and hourly jobs or they have a sophisticated search engine that will enable you to search quickly for part-time jobs in your location. In many cases, you will be able to apply online.
			<br>
			Be Alert:<br>
			If you are interested in retail employment, keep you eye out for "help wanted" signs in store windows when you're at the mall or in town. Ask the Manager if the store is hiring if you don't see a sign.
			<br>
			Check the Ads:<br>
			Review the Help Wanted ads in your local newspaper and pennysaver regularly. Many small employers advertise in the paper, rather than listing online. Apply In Person. Applying in person is often the best mechanism for finding a part-time job. When you apply, your attire should be neat and tidy, hair and fingernails well groomed and your shoes moderate.
			<br>
			What to Bring:<br>
			Bring the information you'll need to fill out an application, including n ames and addresses of previous employers, dates of employment, references, and a resume if you have one. If you're a teen, bring your working papers. Be prepared for a brief on-the-spot interview. Know when you are available to start the job and what hours you can work each week.
			<br>
			Have References Ready:<br>
			Have a list of three references including name and phone number and email address ready to give to interviewers. If you don't have employment references use other people, like people you have babysat for or neighbors, who can vouch for you.
			<br>
			Keep Track:<br>
			Make a list of the companies you have applied to. After an interview, jot down the name of the person you spoke to. It's easy to forgot or get mixed up when you are applying for several jobs. This way you will be prepared if you get a follow-up phone call.
			<br>
			Get Help:
			Utilize free or inexpensive services that provide and job search assistance such as high school guidance offices, college student employment offices and career services offices, state Department of Labor offices and your local public library.
			<br>
			Use Your Network:<br>
			Be aware of the fact that many, if not most, job openings aren't advertised. Tell everyone you know that you are looking for work. Ask if they can help. Just recently, I have heard about someone getting hired for a position that her dentist told her about. Someone else got an internship because he mentioned he was looking at a birthday party. While an acquaintance was offered a job over the phone by an employer his friend had given his resume to. Networking really does work!
